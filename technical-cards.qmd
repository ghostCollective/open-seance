## Accessible {#accessible}
According to the [Go FAIR initiative](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), FAIR research data should be made *accessible* in the following ways: 

> Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.
> 
> A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
>
> A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
>
> A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary
>
> A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

## FAIR {#fair}
In 2026 Wilkinson et al. argued:

> There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles.

FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.

The [Go FAIR initiative](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), gives a great overview on how data can be made FAIR. [FAIR software](https://fair-software.nl/) gives five practical recommendations to make your code FAIR.

<https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>

## Findable {#findable}
According to the [Go FAIR initiative](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), FAIR research data should be made *findable* in the following ways: 

> The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.
> 
> F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
> 
> F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
> 
> F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
> 
> F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

## Interoperable {#interoperable}
According to the [Go FAIR initiative](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), FAIR research data should be made *interoperable* in the following ways: 

> The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.
>
> I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
> 
> I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
> 
> I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

> In short, the term Research Software Engineer (RSE) refers to a professional who combines expertise in software development and methodology with deep knowledge of one or more research fields. RSEs focus on developing and/or maintaining research software, with the aim to answer research questions and solve problems within their research disciplines.

## Reusable {#reusable}
According to the [Go FAIR initiative](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), FAIR research data should be made *reusable* in the following ways: 

> The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.
>
> R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
> 
> R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
> 
> R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
> 
> R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

## Self-archiving {#self-archiving}

> Self-archiving allows authors to upload copies of their work to repositories, making research more accessible. Many publishers allow self-archiving, but they often impose specific conditions, such as embargo periods or restrictions on which version of the manuscript can be shared. Some publishers allow authors to upload the peer-reviewed version after a certain waiting period, while others only allow the preprint version. However, some publishers may still prohibit self-archiving altogether, and authors may need to negotiate permissions or seek individual agreements.
