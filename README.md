# Open Séance

This repository contains the website, cards, and code to create cards for Open Séance, a educational game where players have to find creative ways to describe for concepts around Open Science. If you are interested in the printed game, please reach out to us (rdm@vu.nl).

## Goal of the Game

In Open Séance, two teams compete in a game that is all about picking the right Open Spirits to communicate to while avoiding the ones that are bad for you. Each team has one medium whose task it it is to guide their team members through the Séance. Only the mediums know which of the Open Spirits are FAIR to their team. With that knowledge, it is their task to describe the Open Science concepts that these spirit represent. However, their hints have to be brief, leaving plenty of room for creativity and sharp insights! The team who guesses all their Open Spirits correctly wins this spooky game. But beware of the evil Publishgeist!

The Séance can be held in two ways: 

### 1. The Experience Séance
The group can choose to guess everyday experiences in research practice. These involve examples of not only successes of Open Science, but also challenges and setbacks. In this case, the light yellow side of the Séance cards are used.  

### 2. The Specialist Séance
If the Séance circle is more advanced, they can also decide to play the game around specialist terms in the realm of Open Science. These include the lingo that professional staff and seasoned Open Science practicioners use to commuicate complex concepts in a concise manner.  

## How to Play

🧍4-10 players		⏰ 15-30 minutes	

Before starting, divide the circle of players into two teams, with each team having at least two members. Each team indentifies one player as their medium for the session. Players then decide if the Open Séance will be held with the Experience Spirits (light yellow card faces) or withe the Specialist Spirits (blue card faces). 
Draw 20 Open Spirit cards and arrange them in a grid that is 5 cards wide and 4 cards tall. Make sure that, depending on the format of the Séance the correct side of the cards is facing up.

The mediums together draw a single DMP (Data Management Planchette) card. The DMP shows which of the Open Spirits belong to which team. Both mediums can consult the DMP at any time, but must keep it face down for the rest of the time so to not reveal it to the other players.

Decide which team begins as team red 🔴. The medium sends out their first spiritual message to their team. The message must be FAIR, meaning
F - Focused: The hint should only be one word.
A - Amount: The hint is followed by a number. That is the number of Open Spirits the medium wants their team to reveal this round.
I - Inventive: The medium must not use any of the words that are on any of the Open Spirit cards.
R - Rudimentary: The medium should only say that word and not communicate in any other way.

After the FAIR message has been sent, it is up to the other players of team red 🔴 to use it to identify their friendly Open Spirits. They may discuss the meaning of the message amongst each other and eventually vote on the first card they want to pick. The medium reveals the nature of the Open Spirit by placing the corresponding point card on top of the chosen card, as shown by the DMP. The players then continue to pick cards up until the amount mentioned in the FAIR message, plus one, is reached. For each revealed Spirit of the current teams color that team recieves one point. Each Spirit that is of the other team's color, however, awards that team a point. Revelaed Citizen Spirits give no points. If at any point in time the evil Publishgeist is revealed, the current team loses and the game ends immediately.
Note that at any time during this process, if the players are unsure which Spirit to pick, they may instead also decide to stop choosing spirits and end their turn.

The teams take turns until either all red or all blue Open Spirits are revealed. In that case, the team with the most revealed friendly Ghosts wins. The game also ends if a team reveals the evil Publishgeist. In that case the other team wins automatically.
