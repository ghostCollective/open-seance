In Open S√©ance, two teams compete in a game that is all about picking the right Open Spirits to communicate to while avoiding the ones that are bad for you. Each team has one Medium whose task it is to guide their team members through the S√©ance. Only the Mediums know which of the Open Spirits are FAIR to their team. With that knowledge, it is their task to describe the Open Science concepts that these spirits represent. However, their hints have to be brief, leaving plenty of room for creativity and sharp insights! The team who guesses all their Open Spirits correctly wins this spooky game. But beware of the evil ‚ò†Ô∏è Publish-Geist!

The S√©ance can be held in two ways: 

### 1. The Experience S√©ance üòÆ

The group can choose to guess everyday experiences in research practice. These involve examples of not only successes of Open Science, but also challenges and setbacks. In this case, the light yellow sides of the S√©ance cards is used.  

### 2. The Specialist S√©ance ü§ì

If the S√©ance circle is more advanced, they can also decide to play the game around specialist terms in the realm of Open Science. These include the lingo that professional staff and seasoned Open Science practicioners use to communicate complex concepts in a concise manner. Use the light blue sides of the S√©ance cards for this format.
